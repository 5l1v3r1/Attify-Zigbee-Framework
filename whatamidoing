Okay, here goes, this tool i going to be a GUI for the killerbee framework.
I'm going to focus on itegrating zbid, zbtumbler, zbreplay and zbdump for 
starters. The work is pretty straight forward, the tools already exist, all
i need to do is create a Qt Thread kind of a thing which calls invokes these 
tools with the parameters and I want and give me the output back on the UI.

And hopefully not screw up the output while it's at it. 

Also I'll have to make sure that users use only one tool at once, because 
if multiple tools try to claim the RZ it probably won't work out too well.
